Hi, I'm Tim SchÃ¤fer.
Bioinformatician and currently Research Software Engineer in the department of Biodiversity Informatics at [Senckenberg Society for Nature Research](https://www.senckenberg.de).

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning lots of things about open data, linked data and the semantic web, and sustainable research data management.
- :rocket: I enjoy using tools like Python, Julia, C++, and R to solve scientific problems, build high quality scientific software and promote open science and open research data.
