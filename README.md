Hi, I'm Tim Schäfer.
Bioinformatician and currently Research Software Engineer at [Senckenberg Society for Nature Research](https://www.senckenberg.de).

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust and Neo4j.
- :rocket: I enjoy using tools like Python, Jupyter, Rust, Julia, C++, and R to solve scientific problems, build high quality scientific software and promote open science.
