Hi, I'm Tim Schäfer. I am a bioinformatician and currently a [Research Software Engineer](https://de-rse.org/en/) in the [department of Cognitive Neuropsychology](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/research/department-of-cognitive-neuropsychology.html) at [Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de).

I enjoy using tools like Python, Rust, Julia, C++, Docker and R to solve scientific problems, build high quality scientific software and services, and promote open science and open research data.

I get a ton of Github notifications and things *do* slip through once in a while, so if you want to contact me on something unrelated to my software projects or I missed an issue you created, please [write me an email](https://ts.rcmd.org/contact.html).
