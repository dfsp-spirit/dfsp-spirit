Hi, I'm Tim SchÃ¤fer.
Bioinformatician and currently Research Software Engineer in the department of Biodiversity Informatics at [Senckenberg Society for Nature Research](https://www.senckenberg.de).

- :rocket: I enjoy using tools like Python, Julia, C++, Docker and R to solve scientific problems, build high quality scientific software and services, and promote open science and open research data.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on open linked data, FAIR digital objects, and sustainable research data management at Senckenberg. We use an internal GitLab instance, so my activity here on GitHub may decline a bit, but I still have an eye on the software I maintain, don't worry.

I get a ton of Github notifications and things do slip through, so if you want to contact me on something unrelated to my software projects, please [write me an email](https://ts.rcmd.org/contact.html). Issues with a software should still be reported via Github, of course.
